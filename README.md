# Algorithm Visualiser
> This project is currently on hold as I study abroad this summer at [East China University of Science and Technology (华东理工大学)](https://www.ecust.edu.cn/en/).

This project is an extension of what the author is learning in university. As the author learns about various algorithms, he will develop a visualiser for the algorithm using javascript with the [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library. Similar algorithms will have a consistent style of visualisation and a design pattern will be developed in parallel with the project to promote consistency in the code base as well. Once the author graduates university he will have a visualisation of each of the algorithms he learned, which will demonstrate his understanding and ability to implement each of them.
## Usage
This project is written in javascript using the [p5js](https://p5js.org/) library. The author developed this project in VS Code and ran it locally using Node.js and the [npx  serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) command. However, [p5js](https://p5js.org/) also has a great [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) for easily playing around with projects like these online instead. 

In the current state of the project, clicking on the animation window will play or pause the visualisation. Refreshing the page will reset it.
## Roadmap
1. [ ] Add sorting algorithms to the project.
    - [x] Bubble sort
    - [x] Selection sort
    - [ ] Insertion sort
    - [x] Quick sort
    - [ ] Merge sort
2. [ ] Add searching algorithms to the project.
    - [ ] Depth first search
    - [ ] Breadth first search
    - [ ] Dijkstra's algorithm
    - [ ] A*
3. [ ] Compile into one webpage demo
## Authors and acknowledgments
This project was developed entirely by Trevor Steele, a student of computer science at the University of Huddersfield, and inspired by Daniel Shiffman, author of [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) and [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/).
